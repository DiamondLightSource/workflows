# Workflows

This is the documentation for the current prototype of a new data analysis
platform using [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/) as
the underlying workflow engine. Currently, the easiest way to run a workflow
is to visit the [Diamond Argo Workflow dashboard](https://workflows.diamond.ac.uk)
and submit a workflow task under the workflows tab.

You can also find a list of how-tos about
[Submitting a workflow](how-tos/submit-workflow.md) and
[Mounting the filesystem](how-tos/mount-filesystem.md).
